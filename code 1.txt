Write a function that takes 2 inputs(Sentence and Word), Your function should return a dictionary with the
word as key and the number of occurrences as values.
For example,
Sentence: &#39;azconionionulbegghakl dfge&#39;
Word: &#39;onion&#39;
then the function should return a dictionary,
{‘onion’: 2}

code:
def count_occurrences(main_string, sub_string):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results
    occurrences = {}

    # Check if the sub_string is not empty
    if sub_string:
        # Split the main_string by the sub_string
        parts = main_string.split(sub_string)

        # The number of occurrences will be the length of parts - 1
        num_occurrences = len(parts) - 1

        # Store the result in the dictionary
        occurrences[sub_string] = num_occurrences

    return occurrences

# Example usage:
main_string = "siddalingalinga"
sub_string = "linga"
result = count_occurrences(main_string, sub_string)
print(result)
In this example, the count_occurrences function takes two input strings, main_string and sub_string. It splits the main_string by the sub_string and counts the number of occurrences. The result is stored in a dictionary with the sub_string as the key and the number of occurrences as the value.
















code 
def count_word_occurrences(sentence, word):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the word occurrences.
    word_occurrences = {}

    # Split the sentence into words using whitespace as the delimiter.
    words = sentence.split()

    # Iterate through the words in the sentence.
    for w in words:
        # Remove any non-alphanumeric characters from the word to match it with the input word.
        cleaned_word = ''.join(c for c in w if c.isalnum())
        
        # Check if the cleaned word matches the input word.
        if cleaned_word.lower() == word.lower():
            # Increment the count of the word in the dictionary.
            if word.lower() in word_occurrences:
                word_occurrences[word.lower()] += 1
            else:
                word_occurrences[word.lower()] = 1

    return word_occurrences

# Example usage:
sentence = 'azconionionulbegghakl dfge'
word = 'onion'
result = count_word_occurrences(sentence, word)
print(result)  # Output: {'onion': 2}
