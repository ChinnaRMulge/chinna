Take a sample dataset of your own. Perform a chi-square test using python and explain the
insights you got from the result.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Create a sample dataset with the number of people who prefer each chocolate brand
data = {
    'Dairy Milk': [85, 15],
    'KitKat': [70, 30]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['Popular', 'Not Popular'])

# Perform a chi-square test
chi2, p, _, _ = chi2_contingency(df)

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05  # Significance level

print(f'Chi-Square Statistic: {chi2}')
print(f'p-value: {p}')

if p < alpha:
    print('There is a significant association between chocolate brand and popularity.')
else:
    print('There is no significant association between chocolate brand and popularity.')
In the chi-square test, we set up a contingency table with the observed values for "Popular" and "Not Popular" for both Dairy Milk and KitKat. The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant association between chocolate brand and popularity, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant association.
